### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_

### Tags

#### Implementation

Tags for contacts are implemented as a `Tag` class, and are stored internally in a `Set<Tag>` within the `Person` object. Tags are parsed and created through the `add`, `edit` and `tag` commands, and removed through the `edit` and `untag` commands. Multiple **distinct** tags can also be added for each person.

#### Usage

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Tag mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time.

Step 2. The user executes `add ... t/friend` command to add a person tagged with `friend` into CONNECTIONS.

Step 3. CONNECTIONS displays the newly added contact with the added tag.

Step 4. The user decides to add additional tags to the contact at index 1, and executes `tag 1 t/classmate`.

Step 5. CONNECTIONS will update the specified contact to include the new tag `classmate`

Step 6. The user decides to remove the tag `student` from a contact at index 3, and executes `untag 3 t/student`.

Step 7. CONNECTIONS updates and removes the tag `student` from the contact.

#### Design considerations:

* **Current implementation: Tags are saved within a `Set<Tag>` within `Person`**
  * Pros: Easy to implement and doesn't allow for duplicates. 
  * Cons: Searching for contacts by tags may be slow, especially if there are many contacts, with each contact having multiple tags.
  
* **Alternative: Utilise a separate `HashMap` data structure to map contacts to tags.**
  * Pros: Fast retrieval of tagged contacts.
  * Cons: Difficult to maintain a separate data structure.

### \[Work in progress\] Pin feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The operation are exposed in the `Command` interface as `Command#Execute`, specifically in `PinCommand#Execute`

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the pin mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time.

Step 2. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person.

Step 3. Connections displays the new person. 

Step 4. The user decides that the contact, currently at index 1, is important and should be pinned. User executes pin 1

Step 5. Connections will pin the contact and moves the contact to the top of the list of contacts.

The following sequence diagram shows how the pin operation works:

![PinSequenceDiagram](images/PinSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How pin executes:**

* **Alternative 1:** Person has a boolean field isPinned to indicate if the person is pinned or not
    * Pros: Easy to implement, less memory usage
    * Cons: Less flexibility in expanding the usage of pin.

* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Person has Pin object to indicate if the person is pinned or not
    * Pros: More flexible to expand, other methods can be added to Pin if needed.
    * Cons: Will use more memory.
    

### Find feature

#### Implementation

The operation are exposed in the `Command` interface as `Command#Execute`, specifically in `FindCommand#Execute`

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Find mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application.

Step 2. The user executes `find n/David t/friend t/football` to search for a matching entry.

Step 3. Connections displays any person whose name contains `David` **while also having** `friend` **and** 
`football` tagged to them.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How Find executes:**

* **Alternative 1:** Utilise NameContainsKeywordsPredicate and PersonsTagsContainsCaseInsensitiveTags
    * Pros: Straightforward.
    * Cons: Introduces additional and unnecessary complexities to ModelManager.

* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Create a FindPredicate to store Name(s) and Tag(s)
    * Pros: Cleaner implementation. Only need to modify a method to modify the functionality of Find.
    * Cons: More code.

### FindOr feature

#### Implementation

The operation are exposed in the `Command` interface as `Command#Execute`, specifically in `FindOrCommand#Execute`

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Find mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time.

Step 2. The user executes `findOr n/David n/Henry t/friend t/footnall` to search for a matching entry.

Step 3. Connections displays all persons whose name contains **either** `David` **or** `Henry` **OR** are 
tagged to **either** `friend` **or** `football`.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How FindOr executes:**

* **Alternative 1:** Utilise NameContainsKeywordsPredicate and PersonsTagsContainsCaseInsensitiveTags
    * Pros: Straightforward.
    * Cons: Introduces additional and unnecessary complexities to ModelManager.

* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Create a FindOrPredicate to store Name(s) and Tag(s)
    * Pros: Cleaner implementation. Only need to modify a method to modify the functionality of FindOr.
    * Cons: More code.


### Help feature

#### Implementation

The operation are exposed in the `Command` interface as `Command#Execute`, specifically in `HelpCommand#Execute`

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Help mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time.

Step 2. The user executes `help` to seek help on CONNECTION's usage.

Step 3. CONNECTIONS displays a list of available commands.

Step 4. The user decides to view the usage of `add` to learn to add a contact, and executes `help add`.

Step 5. CONNECTIONS will display a detailed help message on the usage of `add` command.
